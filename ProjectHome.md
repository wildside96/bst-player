The BST Player API makes media player plug-ins available in GWT applications like other GWT widgets.  It also feature a module to export the widgets as Javascript objects in non-GWT applications.

The API also includes a skin interface which makes creating custom HTML based players fun filled.  The custom players can then be used like a cross browser media player.

Starting with version 2.0, the API further provides support of additional player widgets via the newly introduced API/Provider architecture.

### Player Providers ###
The following player provider packages are available:
  * Core Player Provider: Wraps Windows Media Player, QuickTime, Flash player, VLC Media Player, HTML 5 Video and DivX Web Player plugins as GWT widgets
  * YouTube Player Provider: Brings YouTube videos to GWT, the BST Player way
  * Vimeo Player Provider:  Provides support Vimeo video players
